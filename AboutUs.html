									<h3>Who are we?</h3>
									<p>North Star Education, located at #45 North Star Point, sits directly atop one of the most productive Cities in the nation – the second largest in Benguet State, next to the Benguet State University.  North Star Point was discovered during World War II when the need for lumber supplies was imperative to Allied victory.  Looking west toward the field during those days, one would have seen vast forests and lumberyards, chopping large amounts of wood, for gun manufacturing.</p>

									<p>North Star Point was discovered by an Allied Soldier, Ace Gutowski upon advice from farmer Robert Sado who was convinced that, the wood by his property is prime for manufacturing.  This first well brought a swarm of Lumberjacks such as Dean McGee to develop an area of 37,000 acres, operating almost 900 productive Lumberyards. In 1944 alone the area produced 39,000 pallets a day and employed hundreds of workers who greatly boosted Benguet's economy.</p>

									<p>At the time of the school’s opening in 2006, many active Lumberyards continue to operate around its site, reminding us of the significance of the Lumber Trade to our community. Naming the site North Star Education appropriately highlights the geographic location of the school and serves as a reminder of the importance of natural resources to our past and to our future.</p>
