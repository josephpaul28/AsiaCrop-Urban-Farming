									<h3>Who are we?</h3>
									<p>The need of producing farm crops in an urbanized place is a necessity by the effect of the urbanization plan of the country. AsiaCrop Tech, is a start-up business, and it is a Limited Liability Company where we promote Vertical Farming, offer workshops about Vertical Farming, making it into practice, and put the harvested crops in the national market. Interested farmers, and farmer enthusiasts can take the workshop for they can already start practicing or observing how the farming works. We sell the most needed equipments and crop seeds. We also sell crops since we promote Vertical Farming. </p>

									<p>The people behind AsiaCrop Tech will be successful in this business because, this business has the potential to grow and expand to other farm related businesses. We can improve the economy of the country, at the same time, gaining profit from it. Some certain people in the Philippines are trying to tell others that “we should do vertical farming because we can produce more crops”, though no one knows how to do it, so, we offer workshops for it in our available facilities, and make it put into practice. And this method of farming is already used in the most urbanized places like Singapore, Japan, and Israel, so, to increase the production of crops, since the Philippines is trying to be an urban country, and since we still have farmlands to till, increasing the production of farm crops, and exporting them benefits the economy of the Philippines. Also, due to the vulnerability of the country from typhoons, flood, and other possible natural disasters that can harm the food storage and the economy, putting it into practice reduces the possible negative effects to the economy.</p>
